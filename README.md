# KJ To Calorie Converter

In New Zealand, most food items are labeled with their energy value in kilojoules (Kj).

To provide a convenient solution for converting Kj to calories, I developed a user-friendly mobile application.

This app simplifies the process of obtaining calorie ratings for various foods, catering specifically to the New Zealand market.

As someone who values nutritional awareness, having this tool on my phone has greatly enhanced my dietary decision-making.

Leveraging my expertise in Android development, I implemented the converter as a straightforward calculator using Xamarin Android, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for Android users.
